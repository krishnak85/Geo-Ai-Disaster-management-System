# Importing the necessary libraries
import geopandas as gpd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Loading and Preprocessing Data
# Assuming you have a dataset in a CSV file called "disaster_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv("disaster_data.csv")

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
# Perform any necessary data exploration and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib
# ...

# Step 3: Data Preprocessing
# Preprocess the data using Pandas and GeoPandas
# ...

# Step 4: Training and Testing Data Split
X = data.drop("target", axis=1)  # Assuming "target" is the target variable
y = data["target"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Model Training
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 7: Disaster Prediction
# Assuming you have an input image called "disaster_image.jpg"
image = cv2.imread("disaster_image.jpg")
# Perform any necessary preprocessing on the image using OpenCV
# ...

# Step 8: Model Prediction
prediction = model.predict(image)
print("Prediction:", prediction)

# Step 9: Visualization
# Assuming you have a shapefile called "disaster_areas.shp" containing the disaster areas
map_data = gpd.read_file("disaster_areas.shp")
map_data.plot()

# Step 10: Displaying the Results
plt.show()
